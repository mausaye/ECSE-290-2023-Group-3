# Frosty Campus Dash
Frosty Campus Dash is a fun puzzle game built with Unity and C#. Set during the cold winters of Cleveland, Ohio, the game follows a Case Western Reserve University student who must reach the library in time for a game development meeting. However, the path from the dorm to the library is fraught with slippery ice and various barriers. Can you navigate through these obstacles and make it to the library on time?

Frosty Campus Dash offers hundreds of unique puzzles (generated and validated by a Python script) for users to enjoy, ensuring no two experiences are the same. Additionally, you can increase the game's challenge by playing our Night Mode version.
